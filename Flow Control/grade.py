# write a function 'grade_exam' that takes score (0-100) as parameter and
# returns letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') based on standard grading
# criteria

# Bonus Questions:
# 1. Modify function to handle invalid scores by returning error message
# 2. Rewrite function to use a dictionary for grading thresholds
# 3. What would happen if you passed negative number or score greater than 100?
